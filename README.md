You may want to edit:  
-- view/strawpoll.css: the colors of the bars are marked so you can change them

The panel on the dashboard allows you to set:  
-- The StrawPoll ID - the ID is the number from the URL, as in `http://strawpoll.me/<id>/r`  
-- Display Mode. 1v1 will only display the first two answers (in alphabetical order), multiple will show all of them
